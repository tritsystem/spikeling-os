//! MILESTONE 18: a minimal filesystem on top of Milestone 11's raw ATA
//! disk I/O -- until now only one fixed sector (LBA 0) could be
//! persisted (the learned weights); this adds real named-file storage,
//! a genuine "you can save your work" capability.
//!
//! MILESTONE 22: multi-sector files and real delete/reclamation. Each
//! of the 8 directory entries (still at LBA 1) now also stores a
//! start LBA and a sector count, allocated from a shared 64-sector
//! data pool at LBA 2..66 (first-fit over contiguous free runs
//! computed from the currently-used entries, not a persisted
//! bitmap) -- so files genuinely span multiple sectors up to a real
//! cap of MAX_FILE_SECTORS (8) * 512 = 4096 bytes, and `rm` actually
//! frees an entry's sectors back into that pool for a later `write`
//! to reuse, rather than just marking a slot deleted forever.
//!
//! MILESTONE 28: real one-level subdirectories. A directory entry can
//! now be either a file or a subdirectory (a new `is_dir` flag on each
//! entry); a subdirectory's "data" is exactly ONE sector, allocated
//! from the SAME shared pool files already use, holding its own
//! 8-entry table in the identical on-disk format as the root table at
//! LBA 1. `mkdir NAME` only creates directories directly under the
//! root (no `mkdir a/b`), and `write`/`read`/`rm` accept one optional
//! `DIR/` prefix (no `a/b/c`) -- honest, disclosed depth cap of 1,
//! matching the same "deliberately minimal" spirit as the 4096-byte
//! file cap above.
//!
//! MILESTONE 32: real ARBITRARY-DEPTH subdirectory nesting, plus
//! `rmdir`. **No on-disk format change was needed for the nesting
//! part** -- a subdirectory's table was already, since Milestone 28,
//! stored in the IDENTICAL on-disk format as the root table (same
//! `DirEntry` layout, same one-sector allocation out of the same
//! shared pool), so a subdirectory entry's `start_lba` could already
//! point at a table that itself contained further subdirectory
//! entries; Milestone 28 simply capped the *logic* that walks that
//! format at one level (`resolve_table` rejected anything past a
//! single `DIR/NAME`, and `mkdir` rejected any `/` in its argument at
//! all). This milestone replaces that one-level walk with
//! `resolve_dir_lba`, a generic loop over an arbitrary-depth
//! `/`-separated chain of components starting at the root, so
//! `write`/`read`/`rm`/`mkdir`/`rmdir`/`ls` all transparently support
//! any depth now -- callers (the shell) additionally layer a real
//! `cd`/current-working-directory concept on top so a user doesn't
//! have to type a full path every time (see shell.rs). Because a
//! corrupted disk could in principle make a subdirectory's start_lba
//! chain cycle back on itself, `resolve_dir_lba` and the now-recursive
//! `collect_occupied` both enforce a defensive `MAX_DEPTH` (32) so
//! that case fails with an error instead of recursing forever and
//! blowing the kernel's stack -- not a deliberate feature cap; real
//! usable depth is bounded far below that anyway by the shared
//! 64-sector pool (every directory level, like every file, consumes at
//! least one pool sector for its own table).
//!
//! `rmdir NAME` mirrors Milestone 22's file-delete reclamation exactly:
//! it refuses (real check, not a stub) unless the target directory's
//! own table is completely empty, then clears the parent's entry for
//! it -- freeing both the directory's slot in its parent AND its
//! one-sector table back into the shared pool for a later
//! `write`/`mkdir` to reuse, via the exact same "recompute occupancy
//! from currently-used entries" mechanism `collect_occupied` already
//! used for files. `rmdir` never touches a directory's contents itself
//! (no recursive delete) -- that's a deliberately different, more
//! dangerous operation this milestone does not implement.
//!
//! Still deliberately minimal, disclosed rather than hidden: no
//! fragmentation-avoiding allocator and no directory/pool compaction
//! -- a disk that has accumulated enough delete/write churn can fail
//! an allocation with "not enough free disk space" even when the
//! total free sectors would suffice, because free space isn't
//! necessarily contiguous and nothing moves existing files to make
//! room. Subdirectories eat into that same shared pool too (one
//! sector per `mkdir`, at ANY depth now), so heavy subdirectory use
//! leaves less pool space for file data. Each directory table (root or
//! any subdirectory, at any depth) is still capped at the original 8
//! entries -- nesting deeper doesn't change that per-level cap.

//! MILESTONE 46: a real trait/dispatch layer generalizing everything
//! above -- until now `write_file`/`read_file`/`delete_file`/`make_dir`/
//! `remove_dir`/`list` were free functions hardcoded to the one ATA
//! disk-backed store this file has ever had. They're now a thin
//! dispatcher (`resolve_backend`) in front of a real `FileSystem` trait,
//! with the EXACT pre-M46 disk logic moved, byte-for-byte unchanged,
//! into a `DiskFs` trait impl (renamed with a `_disk` suffix internally,
//! e.g. `write_file` -> `write_file_disk`), plus a genuinely SECOND,
//! concrete backing store, `RamFs` -- a flat, in-memory,
//! `BTreeMap<String, Vec<u8>>`-backed filesystem with no ATA I/O at all.
//! Routing is by a reserved top-level path component: any path that IS
//! `"ram"` or starts with `"ram/"` addresses `RamFs` (the remainder
//! after `"ram/"` as its own path); every other path is completely
//! unaffected and still resolves through `DiskFs` exactly as it always
//! has -- `resolve_backend` only ever inspects the FIRST path component,
//! so a disk-side subdirectory named `ram` nested below root (e.g.
//! `sub/ram/file`) is untouched, only a true top-level `ram` is
//! reserved. No shell.rs/process.rs/loader.rs changes were needed for
//! this: every caller already goes through these same module-level
//! functions with a plain path string, so `write ram/foo hello` in the
//! shell, `cd ram` (CWD-relative resolution keeps working unchanged, see
//! shell.rs's `resolve_arg`), and even the fd-backed `open()`/`read()`/
//! `fdwrite()`/`close()` syscalls in process.rs (which call
//! `fs::read_file`/`fs::write_file` directly) all transparently reach
//! `RamFs` for a `ram/...` path with zero code changes outside this
//! file.
//!
//! Honest, disclosed scope-cuts for `RamFs`, matching this file's own
//! established style of a real-but-deliberately-minimal subset:
//! - **Flat namespace only** -- no subdirectories under `ram/`;
//!   `make_dir`/`remove_dir` against it, and any path containing a
//!   second `/` after the mount, are refused with a clear error rather
//!   than silently doing something partial. The disk side's
//!   arbitrary-depth nesting (Milestone 32) is not replicated here.
//! - **No fixed entry-count cap** -- unlike the disk directory table's
//!   fixed 8 slots, a `BTreeMap` has no such limit; it's bounded only by
//!   the kernel's 100 KiB heap (`allocator.rs`), same as any other
//!   dynamically-growing kernel allocation.
//! - **Reuses `MAX_FILE_BYTES` (4096 bytes) as ramfs's own per-file
//!   cap** -- not because ramfs shares the disk's 512-byte-sector
//!   physical constraint (it has none), but so behavior stays
//!   predictable across both backends and one runaway write can't eat
//!   a large fraction of the 100 KiB heap.
//! - **Genuinely volatile** -- `RamFs` never touches `ata::*`; its
//!   contents do not survive a reboot. This is the actual, intended
//!   difference from `DiskFs`, not an oversight.
//! - `list()`'s existing `u16` length field (inherited unchanged from
//!   the pre-M46 trait signature) still silently truncates lengths
//!   above 65535 -- a pre-existing, shared limitation of the return
//!   type itself, not something new introduced by ramfs.
