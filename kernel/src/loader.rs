//! MILESTONE 34: a real general program loader -- until now, every
//! process (Milestone 30's PROCESS_A/PROCESS_B, and Milestone 27's
//! single usertest program before that) ran code from a BYTE ARRAY
//! BAKED DIRECTLY INTO THE KERNEL BINARY (usertest::USER_PROGRAM). This
//! module closes that gap for real: the `runfile PATH` shell command
//! reads a file's bytes off the actual on-disk filesystem (fs.rs,
//! Milestones 18/22/28/32) and hands them to
//! process::create_loaded_process()/run_loaded_process() (MILESTONE 35:
//! split from one original load_and_run_image() function -- see
//! run_file()'s own comment below for why) -- the EXACT SAME private-
//! PML4/P3/P2/P1 mechanism Milestone 30 established for PROCESS_A/
//! PROCESS_B, just sourced from a runtime file read instead of a
//! compile-time array. No
//! new page-table code was written for this: process.rs's
//! create_process() was refactored into a create_process_from_image()
//! core (taking an arbitrary `&[u8]`) plus a thin wrapper that rebuilds
//! the ORIGINAL fixed PROCESS_PROGRAM+message layout PROCESS_A/PROCESS_B
//! still use -- so both the hardcoded-array path and this file-loaded
//! path provably run through identical, unduplicated unsafe mapping
//! code.
//!
//! Honest limitations, disclosed rather than hidden (same spirit as
//! every prior milestone's own scoping notes, and this project's own
//! README, which already flags a real ELF loader as future work):
//!   - flat binary only -- no ELF (or any other object-file format)
//!     parsing, no relocations, no sections, no symbol table, no
//!     dynamic linking. A "program" here is just raw machine code
//!     copied verbatim to a fixed load address (usertest::USER_CODE_ADDR)
//!     at a fixed offset 0, exactly like usertest::USER_PROGRAM always
//!     was -- this milestone only changes WHERE those bytes come from,
//!     not what they're allowed to look like.
//!   - fixed max program size: one 4KiB page
//!     (process::MAX_CODE_IMAGE_BYTES), enforced BEFORE any copy
//!     happens -- an oversized file is rejected with a clear error,
//!     never silently truncated or allowed to overflow into whatever
//!     physical frame happens to follow the code frame in the new
//!     process's (private) address space.
//!   - only ONE loaded-from-file process can be resident at a time
//!     (process::LOADED_PROCESS is a single Mutex<Option<Process>>
//!     slot, replaced -- not accumulated -- by each `runfile` call),
//!     matching PROCESS_A/PROCESS_B's own one-shot-per-slot design
//!     rather than a general process table with PIDs.
//!   - no argv/envp, no file descriptors the loaded program can use to
//!     read further files itself -- it gets the same syscalls
//!     usertest.rs already implements (0 = write, 1 = exit). It DOES get
//!     a private heap mapped (Milestone 33's heap is now uniform across
//!     every process, loaded-from-file or not), but `sbrk` (syscall 2)
//!     currently only recognizes PROCESS_A/PROCESS_B's ids -- a
//!     loaded-from-file process's heap is real and mapped, but not
//!     currently reachable via sbrk. Disclosed, not hidden: nothing in
//!     this milestone's own test program needs it.
//!
//! MILESTONE 36: the real ELF loader flagged above as future work now
//! exists, ADDITIONALLY -- `runelf PATH` alongside `runfile PATH`, not
//! instead of it. `runfile`'s flat-binary behavior above is completely
//! unchanged: same functions, same limitations, same test program. The
//! new `runelf` path reads a file's bytes the same way, then hands them
//! to kernel/src/elf.rs's real ELF64 parser instead of assuming they're
//! already flat code at offset 0 -- see elf.rs and
//! process::create_process_from_elf() for the actual parsing/loading
//! logic and this milestone's honest scoping decision (real ELFs
//! specifically linked for this kernel's fixed entry address, not
//! arbitrary Linux binaries).
