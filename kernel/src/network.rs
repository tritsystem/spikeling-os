//! MILESTONE 12: a real, dynamically-definable spiking network --
//! Milestone 9/10/11's LeftKey/RightKey/Motor network is fixed Rust
//! structure; this brings the actual PROGRAMMABILITY of Spikeling's
//! own .spk language into the kernel, via shell commands instead of a
//! file (no filesystem yet), so networks can be built and rewired at
//! runtime rather than only at compile time.
//!
//! Ticked on every real timer interrupt.
//!
//! MILESTONE 21: this is now the ONLY neuron/synapse representation and
//! the ONLY STDP implementation in the kernel. Milestone 9/10/11's
//! LeftKey/RightKey/Motor network used to be a second, independently-
//! implemented copy (its own LifNeuron/Network structs, its own
//! duplicated apply_stdp, its own tick() called separately from
//! interrupts.rs) that happened to start from the same initial values
//! but shared no live state with this file -- a real keypress
//! stimulating LeftKey there was invisible to `net`/`stim`/`addneuron`
//! here, and vice versa, an honestly-disclosed gap for several
//! milestones. neurons.rs now seeds LeftKey/RightKey/Motor into THIS
//! GenericNetwork at boot (seed_fixed_network, below) and every fixed
//! command (`neurons`, bare `train`, `save`) reads/writes these same
//! Neuron/Synapse entries by name -- one engine, one STDP formula, one
//! set of live numbers, provably shared (see the M21 test evidence in
//! the shell session this milestone was verified with).
//!
//! Unifying onto this engine's tick() also means LeftKey/RightKey/Motor
//! now propagate firings with this engine's one-tick synaptic delay
//! (firing THIS tick becomes stimulus on the NEXT tick) instead of the
//! old fixed network's same-tick propagation -- a real, disclosed
//! behavioral change from having two separately-timed engines collapse
//! into one, not a silently swept-under-the-rug difference. The LIF
//! constants that Milestone 9/10 actually verified (threshold, leak,
//! refractory period, STDP rate/tau, initial weight) are unchanged --
//! see neurons.rs for the exact values preserved at seed time.
//!
//! MILESTONE 39: real two-timescale, evidence-gated connectivity --
//! ported from a separate, real project (`012-ternary`'s `tritkit`,
//! `tritkit/twotimescale.py`'s `TwoTimescaleLinear`), NOT invented from
//! scratch. tritkit's own real mechanism: factorize a connection into a
//! FAST polarity/sign (trained every step) and a SLOW binary
//! connectivity gate `G` (re-selected only periodically, from an EMA of
//! evidence that is DELIBERATELY NOT the weight itself). tritkit's own
//! module doc documents a REAL, MEASURED failure mode from an earlier
//! version of that codebase: gating a connection from its own current
//! weight is self-reinforcing (a weak connection gets gated off, so it
//! never again accumulates the activity needed to prove it should turn
//! back on -- permanently locked out). Their fix: the gate integrates
//! an EMA of something INDEPENDENT of the weight -- for them, the full
//! UNGATED gradient magnitude (computed for every parameter every step,
//! whether currently live or dormant). Ported here as:
//!   - FAST clock (every tick a synapse's endpoint fires): update
//!     `Synapse.evidence`, an EMA of REAL pre/post firing correlation
//!     (did the post-synaptic neuron fire within CORRELATION_WINDOW_TICKS
//!     of the pre-synaptic neuron firing) -- a genuine, independent
//!     sensing channel, computed from firing TIMING, never from
//!     `Synapse.weight`. Runs for every synapse regardless of its gate
//!     state (see evidence loop in tick(), below) -- the exact property
//!     tritkit's own history says is required to avoid permanent
//!     lockout.
//!   - SLOW clock (every GATE_PERIOD_TICKS ticks, deliberately
//!     INCOMMENSURATE with the fast evidence-accumulation cadence --
//!     tritkit's own `golden_period()`, golden-ratio spaced, ported
//!     verbatim as `golden_period()` below): re-evaluate
//!     `Synapse.gate` from `Synapse.evidence` (hysteresis band, see
//!     `evaluate_gates()`).
//!   - Gate OFF: `Synapse.weight` is FROZEN (STDP skipped, see the STDP
//!     loop's `gate &&` guard) and the synapse's contribution is
//!     REMOVED from real propagation (see the propagation loop's
//!     `s.gate` filter) -- tritkit's "structural memory": dormant state
//!     is preserved unchanged, not reset/re-randomized, so a later
//!     reconnect resumes exactly where it left off.
//!   - Gate back ON: evaluated the same way, from the same evidence EMA
//!     -- real reconnection, not just structurally possible.
//! Honest scope, matching this project's own "honest bound, not full
//! generality" style (see e.g. `MAX_OPEN_FILES`/`MAX_LOAD_SEGMENTS`):
//! `Synapse.gate` is a plain bool (tritkit's `G` is a whole tensor of
//! gates with a density-fraction selection rule; one synapse here is
//! the same idea at kernel scale, an absolute evidence threshold with
//! hysteresis instead of a population-relative top-fraction rule).
//! `train_synapse()` (the M17/21 controlled STDP trial, used by bare
//! `train` and DSL `train FROM TO GAP`) intentionally bypasses BOTH
//! real tick()-driven dynamics AND this gating layer, exactly as it
//! already bypassed real propagation timing before this milestone --
//! it's a synthetic trial tool, not real network dynamics, so it
//! continues to always apply STDP directly regardless of gate state,
//! preserving Milestone 17/21's exact regression behavior byte-for-
//! byte. Gate state and evidence are NOT persisted to disk (Milestone
//! 38's scope only covers `Synapse.weight`) -- same disclosed
//! "topology doesn't persist" limitation as before, extended to say
//! gate/evidence also start fresh (gate=ON, evidence=neutral) every
//! boot.
