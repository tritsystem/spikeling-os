//! MILESTONE 30: real per-process address space isolation. Milestone 27
//! got exactly one ring-3 program running, but disclosed honestly in its
//! own report that it ran under the KERNEL's own page tables -- the user
//! code page and user stack page were mapped into the SAME
//! OffsetPageTable kernel_main built at boot, alongside every other
//! kernel mapping, with nothing but the USER_ACCESSIBLE flag standing
//! between "ring 3" and "can see the whole kernel address space". This
//! module closes that gap: each `Process` gets its own top-level page
//! table (PML4) in its own physical frame, entered via a real CR3 switch
//! before `iretq` and switched back on exit -- proven by running two
//! distinct hardcoded processes at the IDENTICAL virtual code address
//! (usertest::USER_CODE_ADDR) and showing each one genuinely executes
//! its own distinct physical memory, invisible to the other.
//!
//! The design deliberately does NOT deep-copy the kernel's page table
//! hierarchy into each process -- a naive full copy would silently go
//! stale the instant the kernel maps anything new later (e.g. heap
//! growth), a real bug class this avoids rather than risks:
//!
//!   - every PML4 entry OUTSIDE the user-space index is a raw COPY OF
//!     THE ENTRY ITSELF (a pointer to the kernel's existing, already-
//!     built P3 table), not a deep copy of the hierarchy underneath it
//!     -- so every process's kernel-space view stays bit-for-bit
//!     identical to the kernel's own forever, automatically, because
//!     it's the literal same physical P3 table in memory. Any future
//!     kernel mapping change is instantly visible to every process, with
//!     zero ongoing sync cost and zero staleness risk.
//!   - the ONE PML4 entry covering both usertest::USER_CODE_ADDR and
//!     usertest::USER_STACK_ADDR -- computed for real below (p4_index()
//!     on the actual addresses, not assumed), both landing on index 170
//!     -- is left zeroed in the new PML4, then `OffsetPageTable::map_to`
//!     is used against that fresh table to build a genuinely new,
//!     private P3/P2/P1 chain backed by this process's own physical
//!     frames. create_process() checks the two addresses actually share
//!     a p4 index at runtime and fails loudly (not silently) if that
//!     assumption is ever violated.
//!
//! Still exactly two hardcoded processes (no general loader, no
//! per-process heap or file descriptors -- later work). The isolation
//! itself is real: verified by CR3 genuinely changing (logged before and
//! after every switch), by each process's write(ptr,len) syscall reading
//! its OWN message out of ITS OWN physical code-page frame at the SAME
//! virtual offset every other process uses, and by re-running process A
//! after process B with no cross-contamination.
//!
//! MILESTONE 31: the syscall that proves this per-process isolation
//! generalized from Milestone 27's fixed-string "print" (syscall 0 took
//! no arguments at all) to a real `write(ptr, len)` -- create_process()
//! below now installs each process's message through
//! usertest::write_fixed_message() (the exact same helper the legacy
//! usertest.rs code path uses for ITS message), and the old
//! read_active_message() helper that only ever read one hardcoded offset
//! is gone, superseded by usertest.rs's syscall_dispatch generically
//! reading whatever `ptr`/`len` the calling process's own USER_PROGRAM
//! passed in registers.
//!
//! MILESTONE 33: each process also gets its own private HEAP, a fixed
//! 16 KiB region at HEAP_START pre-mapped by create_process() the same
//! way code/stack are. `HEAP_START` shares USER_CODE_ADDR/
//! USER_STACK_ADDR's p4_index (170), so it lands inside the SAME
//! already-private PML4 slot Milestone 30 rebuilds per process --
//! genuinely private with zero new PML4-level reasoning needed. A real
//! syscall (2 = sbrk, in usertest.rs) is the process's only way to grow
//! into it, chosen over a kernel-only allocator because `int 0x80` is
//! this kernel's one sanctioned ring-3-to-ring-0 boundary: a kernel-side
//! allocator unreachable from ring 3 wouldn't give the PROCESS a real
//! way to allocate. Process A/B now run PROCESS_PROGRAM (this module's
//! own hand-assembled binary, not usertest::USER_PROGRAM) so they can
//! exercise sbrk before printing; usertest::USER_PROGRAM and the plain
//! `usertest` command are completely untouched.
//!
//! MILESTONE 34: a real general program loader (kernel/src/loader.rs)
//! removes the "hardcoded" half of the original limitation. The page-
//! table-building core of create_process() is factored out into
//! create_process_from_image(), which builds the SAME private
//! PML4/P3/P2/P1 chain (code, stack, AND heap -- every process gets one
//! uniformly, loaded-from-file or not) from an arbitrary `&[u8]` code
//! image instead of always copying PROCESS_PROGRAM. create_process()
//! (used by PROCESS_A/PROCESS_B) becomes a thin wrapper that builds its
//! PROCESS_PROGRAM+heap-marker+message image as a `Vec<u8>` first, then
//! hands it to the shared core -- loader.rs's `runfile` calls the new
//! create_loaded_process()/run_loaded_process() below (MILESTONE 35:
//! split from one original load_and_run_image() function -- see
//! run_loaded_process()'s own doc comment) with bytes read straight from
//! the real on-disk filesystem instead. No page-table code is duplicated between
//! the two paths.
//!
//! MILESTONE 36: a real ELF64 loader (kernel/src/elf.rs does the actual
//! parsing; create_process_from_elf() below does the loading).
//! Deliberately kept SEPARATE from create_process_from_image() above,
//! rather than folded into it or refactored to share its body -- partly
//! because the shapes genuinely differ (one fixed page at one fixed
//! address vs. an arbitrary number of pages at segment-declared
//! addresses), and partly a deliberate choice to minimize process.rs
//! churn while Milestone 35 (real per-process file descriptors) is
//! being built concurrently against this same file from the same
//! Milestone 34 baseline -- additive new functions merge far more
//! cleanly than a refactor of shared code both branches touch.
//!
//! The real, honest scoping decision (option (a) from the milestone
//! brief, not option (b)): this milestone does NOT make the ring-3
//! entry trampoline's jump target dynamic. usertest::enter_ring3_now()
//! still hardcodes USER_CODE_ADDR as the iretq target, exactly as
//! Milestone 27 left it. So create_process_from_elf() below requires --
//! checked for real, not assumed -- that the ELF's own e_entry equals
//! USER_CODE_ADDR exactly, and that every PT_LOAD segment is page-
//! aligned and fits a small, fixed per-segment/total page cap. This is
//! real, deeper surgery on Milestone 27/30's carefully-built ring-3
//! entry mechanism deliberately AVOIDED in favor of shipping a smaller,
//! fully-verified change: an ELF genuinely linked for this kernel's own
//! fixed entry address loads and runs for real, with real multi-page,
//! multi-segment mapping (not "arbitrary Linux ELF binaries", which
//! would additionally need position-independent/dynamic entry support,
//! a real page-fault-driven demand loader or relocations, and is
//! explicitly out of scope here, same as this project's own README
//! already scopes "full Linux ELF/libc compatibility" as separate,
//! much-later work).
//!
//! MILESTONE 37: real `fork`/`exec`/`wait` -- the "single biggest
//! structural gap toward a real Unix process model" the README's own
//! Linux-comparability roadmap named after Milestone 36. **The real,
//! honest scoping decision, stated up front**: this is option (a) from
//! the milestone brief, NOT option (b). `tasks.rs`/`scheduler.rs`'s real
//! preemptive, timer-interrupt-driven scheduler is UNCHANGED by this
//! milestone -- it still only schedules ring-0 kernel tasks, exactly as
//! Milestone 25 left it. Ring-3 process execution stays exactly what it
//! has been since Milestone 27: a synchronous "call out and block" model
//! where the kernel is not doing anything ELSE while a ring-3 process
//! runs. `fork()` genuinely creates a new process -- a new PML4, new
//! physical frames, and a REAL byte-for-byte copy of the parent's own
//! code/stack/heap frame CONTENTS (not shared references -- this kernel
//! still has no copy-on-write) -- but the child does not run
//! "concurrently" with the parent in any sense a real scheduler would
//! recognize. Instead, exactly as the milestone brief's own suggested
//! v1 describes: the child is created and its address space fully,
//! genuinely built at `fork()` time, but it only actually EXECUTES when
//! the parent's own `wait()` syscall explicitly drives it -- `wait()`
//! synchronously switches CR3 to the child, runs it all the way to ITS
//! OWN `exit()` syscall (nested inside the parent's `wait()` syscall's
//! own dispatch), then restores the parent's context and returns. This
//! is a genuine, real implementation of "block until a child changes
//! state" for a kernel with no other way to run "something else" in the
//! meantime -- not a simulation of it.
//!
//! Two further real, honest, DISCLOSED simplifications on top of that
//! core scoping decision:
//!   - A forked child resumes at the EXACT (rip, rsp) captured from the
//!     parent's own hardware-recorded `SyscallRegs` at the moment
//!     `fork()` was called (with rax forced to 0, fork()'s "0 in the
//!     child" contract) -- NOT at `USER_CODE_ADDR`. This matters for
//!     real correctness, not just fidelity: the ring-3 entry trampoline
//!     (`usertest::enter_ring3_now()`) was deliberately kept fixed at
//!     `USER_CODE_ADDR` rather than made dynamic (same Milestone 36
//!     decision, restated above) -- if the child were instead restarted
//!     from the top of its own program, it would immediately execute
//!     the SAME `fork()` call again (an infinite fork loop), not
//!     "continue past its own fork() call" the way real fork() must.
//!     `usertest::enter_ring3_as_forked_child()` is a second, dedicated
//!     entry trampoline built for exactly this -- see its own doc
//!     comment.
//!   - Nesting depth is bounded at exactly 1, enforced for real (checked
//!     and refused, not just documented): a forked child currently being
//!     resumed by `wait()` cannot itself `fork()`/`wait()`. This is a
//!     direct, honest consequence of using ONE dedicated kernel-resume
//!     anchor (`usertest::CHILD_KERNEL_RSP`) for the nested child
//!     excursion rather than a general per-nesting-level stack of
//!     anchors -- the same "small fixed cap, not full generality" spirit
//!     as `MAX_OPEN_FILES`/`MAX_LOAD_SEGMENTS` elsewhere in this
//!     codebase, applied to nesting depth instead of a table size.
//!
//! A real, dynamic, bounded PROCESS_TABLE (MAX_PROCESSES = 4, real PID
//! allocation starting at PID_TABLE_BASE = 10) backs `fork()`-created
//! children -- see that static's own doc comment for why the FOUR
//! pre-existing hardcoded/loaded-file slots (PROCESS_A, PROCESS_B,
//! LOADED_PROCESS, FDTEST_PROCESS) were left as legacy, separate statics
//! rather than migrated in. `exec()` reuses this same table/dispatch
//! uniformly (any process id, hardcoded or forked, can `exec()`) and
//! replaces ONLY the calling process's code-frame CONTENTS in place --
//! same PID, same PML4, same open fds, same mapped heap frames (with
//! `heap_used` reset to 0, a fresh heap for the new image) -- reusing
//! `MAX_CODE_IMAGE_BYTES` and the exact zero-then-copy step
//! `create_process_from_image()` already uses for a brand-new process's
//! code page, not a duplicated implementation of it.
//!
//! Verified for real: `runfork` (new shell command) runs a new
//! hand-assembled FORK_TEST_PROGRAM that calls `fork()`, branches on the
//! return value (0 = child), has the parent print a distinguishing
//! message and then `wait()` for the child, and has the child `exec()`
//! into a completely different on-disk program (`testprog`, from
//! Milestone 34's `seedtestprog`) which prints ITS OWN distinguishing
//! message instead -- real, observable proof that fork() created a
//! genuinely separate process (different PID, independently verified
//! physical frames) and exec() genuinely replaced its code, with the
//! parent's `wait()` genuinely blocking until that whole sequence
//! completes. See the milestone report for the actual captured serial
//! log.
