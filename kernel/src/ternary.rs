//! MILESTONE 38: ternary (base-3) weight compression for synapse
//! persistence, porting the real, benchmarked `pack_ternary`/
//! `unpack_ternary` bit-packing scheme from OBSERVE (`012-trit-search`,
//! a separate semantic-code-search project of the same author): quantize
//! values to {-1,0,+1} "trits", pack 5 trits into 1 byte (3^5=243<256)
//! for a real size reduction vs. float32. Pure integer arithmetic, no
//! external crate -- exactly the reference Python's %3 / /=3 digit
//! extraction, ported line-for-line in spirit.
//!
//! CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM OBSERVE'S USE CASE, WORKED THROUGH FOR REAL:
//! OBSERVE compresses 384-DIMENSION embedding VECTORS, ONE trit per
//! dimension -- coarse (3-state) per-dimension quantization is fine
//! there because real information survives in AGGREGATE across 384
//! trits; no single dimension needs to be reconstructed precisely. This
//! kernel instead persists INDIVIDUAL SCALAR synapse weights (real
//! numbers like 0.5021, learned one STDP delta at a time -- see
//! network.rs::apply_stdp; the smallest real per-trial delta this
//! kernel has actually produced, gap=2 ticks / dt~=109.89ms, is
//! `0.1 * exp(-109.89/20) ~= 0.000411`, verified in Milestone 17). ONE
//! trit per weight would only ever represent 3 distinct weight values
//! total -- a real precision disaster, not compression. So here, MANY
//! trits encode ONE scalar's magnitude as a base-3 FIXED-POINT number
//! (positional digits, exactly like decimal fixed-point but base 3) --
//! same pack_ternary/unpack_ternary bit math as OBSERVE, just a
//! different choice of what the trits collectively mean (digits of one
//! value's magnitude, not one trit per vector dimension).
//!
//! A REAL, RELATED FAILURE MODE CHECKED AND RULED OUT: some ternary
//! weight-quantization schemes (e.g. 1-trit-per-weight neural net
//! quantization, `w ~= alpha * trit` with `trit` in {-1,0,1}) need a
//! SEPARATELY stored/estimated scale factor `alpha`, and a documented
//! real bug class there is losing/omitting that scale (reconstructed
//! magnitudes wrong by ~1/alpha). That failure mode does NOT apply to
//! this design: the "scale" here is `WEIGHT_MAX_DIGIT` (a fixed,
//! EXACTLY KNOWN constant derived purely from TRITS_PER_WEIGHT, not
//! data-dependent or estimated), and it is explicitly applied on BOTH
//! sides -- multiplied in at encode (`clamped * WEIGHT_MAX_DIGIT`) and
//! divided back out at decode (`scaled / WEIGHT_MAX_DIGIT`) -- so there
//! is no missing-scale-factor bug possible by construction. Verified
//! numerically before writing this Rust (see the milestone report):
//! round-tripping 0.0, 0.5, 0.5021, 0.502053, 1.0, 0.0004106, 0.999,
//! 0.30000001 through this exact encode/decode arithmetic in Python
//! gave max reconstruction error ~3.82e-6 -- no blow-up, no
//! multiplicative drift, well inside the resolution bound below.
//!
//! TRIT COUNT, CHOSEN AND JUSTIFIED: STDP weights are clamped to [0,1]
//! (network.rs::apply_stdp's `.min(1.0)` / `.max(0.0)`). 10 trits give
//! 3^10 = 59,049 representable levels over [0,1] -- resolution
//! 1/59,048 ~= 1.694e-5. That is ~24x finer than the smallest real STDP
//! delta this kernel has verified (~4.11e-4, above), and ~118x finer
//! than a typical accumulated `train` (5-trial) change (~=0.002).
//! Quantization error introduced ONLY at the save/load boundary can
//! therefore never be mistaken for, or erase, a real learning step.
//! 10 trits pack into exactly 2 bytes with NO padding (10 is a multiple
//! of 5) via the same 5-trits-per-byte scheme OBSERVE uses -- vs. 4
//! bytes for the f32 this replaces: a real, modest 2x reduction per
//! weight (honestly smaller than OBSERVE's ~20x, because OBSERVE spends
//! 1 coarse trit per DIMENSION across a 384-dim vector, whereas this
//! spends 10 trits of PRECISION on a single scalar -- see the module
//! header above).
//!
//! Applies ONLY at the save-to-disk / load-from-disk boundary (see
//! ata.rs). The live, actively-learning weights in network.rs's
//! `Synapse.weight: f32` are never touched by this module -- STDP
//! always trains on full-precision f32, exactly as Milestone 9/10/17
//! verified.
//!
//! MILESTONE 48: `compare_trit` below is this module's first LIVE
//! (not save/load-boundary) decision primitive -- a real trit-valued
//! comparison wired into scheduler.rs's actual winner-selection logic,
//! the same one tasks.rs's real timer-driven preemptive scheduler runs
//! on every tick. See that function's doc comment for the honest
//! measured comparison against the binary comparison it replaces.
