//! MILESTONE 27: real ring-3 (CPL=3) execution and a minimal `int 0x80`
//! syscall ABI. Every single thing that has run in this kernel through
//! Milestone 26 -- the shell, the neuron simulation, every device
//! driver, all 8 fixed+spawned worker tasks from Milestone 25 -- has run
//! at CPL=0. This module is the first code in spikeling-os that actually
//! drops to CPL=3 and proves it with hardware-recorded evidence, not a
//! self-reported claim -- the real prerequisite for the project's
//! longer-term goal of eventually running code not written specifically
//! for this kernel.
//!
//! Scope, deliberately minimal (see the milestone report for the full
//! list): ONE hardcoded ring-3 program, ONE mapped user code page, ONE
//! mapped user stack page, exactly two syscalls (0 = print a FIXED
//! kernel-owned message -- no general copy-from-user pointer-safety
//! mechanism exists yet, deliberately out of scope this milestone -- and
//! 1 = exit back to whatever called into ring 3). No per-process
//! isolation, no scheduler integration for user tasks: Milestone 28+
//! territory.
//!
//! MILESTONE 31: syscall 0 stops being "print one hardcoded kernel-side
//! string" and becomes a REAL `write(ptr, len)` syscall -- the ring-3
//! program now passes a real pointer (rdi) and length (rsi) in
//! registers, and syscall_dispatch reads those exact bytes out of
//! whatever address space is CURRENTLY loaded in CR3 (the calling
//! process's own private PML4 for a process.rs process, or the kernel's
//! own shared page tables for the legacy `usertest` path) and writes
//! them, raw, to the serial console. This is the generalization of
//! Milestone 30's read_active_message() (which only ever read ONE fixed
//! offset) to an arbitrary caller-supplied pointer+length. See
//! MAX_WRITE_LEN below for the one real safety net in place -- there is
//! still no general copy-from-user fault-recovery path, disclosed
//! honestly, not hidden.
//!
//! MILESTONE 35: real per-process file descriptors -- syscalls 3 (open),
//! 4 (read), 5 (fdwrite), 6 (close), all NEW syscall numbers, syscall 0
//! left completely untouched. See process.rs's own doc comment (right
//! above MAX_OPEN_FILES/OpenFile) for the full "why new syscalls instead
//! of generalizing write(ptr,len) into write(fd,ptr,len)" reasoning --
//! the short version: generalizing syscall 0 would require regenerating
//! every existing hand-assembled program's register setup (USER_PROGRAM
//! below, process.rs's PROCESS_PROGRAM, loader.rs's
//! build_test_program_image()), for no benefit that outweighs touching
//! three already-verified programs. All four new syscalls reuse the
//! EXACT SAME "read/write raw bytes at a caller-supplied pointer, through
//! whatever CR3 is currently loaded" technique syscall 0 established --
//! open()'s path string and fdwrite()'s data are read out of user memory
//! the same way syscall 0 always has, and read() writes its result back
//! into user memory the same way. The actual open/read/write/close
//! bookkeeping (the per-process fd table, buffering, close-time persist)
//! lives in process.rs, not here -- this file's job is exactly what it
//! already was for syscall 0: validate/cap the raw pointer+length
//! arguments and cross the user/kernel memory boundary safely, nothing
//! filesystem-specific.

/// Every other GPR is left as whatever was last in these physical
/// registers (the SAME "fresh entry, no GPR restore" behavior
/// enter_ring3() already has) -- a real, honest, deliberate
/// simplification: FORK_TEST_PROGRAM (this milestone's own hand-
/// assembled test) is written to only ever depend on rax immediately
/// after its own fork() call (`mov rbx, rax; cmp rbx, 0; je
/// child_path`), so a full 15-register save/restore (which the parent's
/// own SyscallRegs snapshot technically has, but this function does not
/// thread through) is real, disclosed, unneeded surgery for what this
/// milestone's actual test program requires -- a general "resume this
/// process exactly as if fork() had simply returned" would need it, a
/// hand-assembled program under this project's own full control does
/// not.
